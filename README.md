This is a sample of Spring Data JPA with the basic CRUD operation and REST services, and I used the following technologies:
* Spring Boot 2.0.4.RELEASE

* MySQL Database 5.5

How to run?

1. Download dependencies and compile the project with the following command:

   ```mvn clean install```

2. The project is a Spring Boot Application, so you can run inside of your IDE or from terminal with the following command:

   ```mvn spring-boot:run```

I used the postman as a client to test the endpoints, you can import the collection, the file is in:
